## What?

## Why?

CubeKrowd has strict rules regarding allowed mods, which means some aren’t allowed due to providing an unfair advantage. This mod implements certain features in a way that’s compatible with these rules, such as limiting some of them to the Creative server. Furthermore, the mod includes some features specific to CubeKrowd, such as Autoswitch for MissileWars.
