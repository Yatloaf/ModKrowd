# ModKrowd

To use this mod, download it from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/modkrowd).

## What?

This is a mod made specifically for **CubeKrowd**, the best<sup>[*[citation needed](https://cubekrowd.net/)*]</sup> Minecraft server. It includes several features that can be toggled via the config screen, accessible through either Mod Menu or a keybind unbound by default.

## Why?

CubeKrowd has strict rules regarding allowed mods, which means some aren’t allowed due to providing an unfair advantage. This mod implements certain features in a way that’s compatible with these rules, such as limiting some of them to the Creative server. Furthermore, the mod includes some features specific to CubeKrowd, such as Autoswitch for MissileWars.
